# REFLECTIVE DLL INJECTION

## About
I decided to write my POC about reflective dll injection in order
to learn how this technique works.

To better understand how reflective dll injection works see [stephenfewer](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection).

## Compile
Open reffDllInje.sln with visual studio and compile it in release mode.

## Usage
>reffDllInje.exe to inject in currenr process

>reffDllInje.exe [pid] to inject in another process
